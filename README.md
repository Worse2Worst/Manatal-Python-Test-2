# Manatal-Python-Test-2     
Q: In a lottery game, there is a container that contains 50 balls numbered from 1 to 50. The lottery game consists in picking 10 balls out of the container and ordering them in ascending order.
Write a Python function that generates the output of a lottery game (it should return a list). Also, describe which unit tests you could implement to test the output of your function.       

A: Please look at "lottery.py".     

About the unit tests, we should check that:     
1. The input numbers are really from 1 to 50.     
2. The output is a list.    
3. The output has 10 unique numbers, ranging from 1 to 50.
4. The output is sorted in ascending order.

Time used: around 10-15 minutes.
